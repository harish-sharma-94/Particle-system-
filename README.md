# Spark Particle system

## Various Levels of Complexities:

L0: Basic natural motion of sparks (projectile motion, air and ground friction)  
L1: Collision with ground plane  
L2: Sparks should split randomly post collision to give variation  
L3: Collision with a minimum of one of the given primitive shapes  
L4: Collision with the ‘Stanford Bunny’
